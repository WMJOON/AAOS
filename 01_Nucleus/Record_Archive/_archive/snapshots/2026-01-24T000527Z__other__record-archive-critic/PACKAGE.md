# Archive Package: Record Archive Critic

## Summary

- Why this package exists: Root-level `CRITIC.md` is removed; critique is preserved as append-only archive evidence.
- What it proves: The critique content and its timestamped fixation.
- What can be reproduced from it: The exact critique text (payload) and its manifest hash.

## Contents

- `payload/CRITIC.md`
- `MANIFEST.sha256`
